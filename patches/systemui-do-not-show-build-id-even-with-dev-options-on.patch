Do not show build ID on lock screen with developer options on

As technical people, you might have developer options enabled often but donâ€™t like the "information leak" that gives away that a) you have developer options on and b) what exact Android build you are running. Removing this information from the lock screen is of course security by obscurity but you still might consider doing it.

Even with this patch, an attacker could still get this information by booting into recovery, but this would have the advantage for us that the main OS is shut down then. Also, doing this would be noticeable for the user as strong auth is required after reboot.

Confirmed working on:

* Android 10 (Showing the build ID there has been introduced with Android 10)
